# Guess The Number AI Evolution
## Project Description
This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to train an AI to play the "Guess The Number" game. The AI evolves over generations, improving its guessing strategy through selection, crossover, and mutation processes. The goal is to create an AI that can efficiently guess a number within a specified range with minimal attempts.

## Game Explanation
"Guess The Number" is a simple game where the AI attempts to guess a hidden number within a given range. The AI receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The AI uses this feedback to adjust its subsequent guesses.

## Features
Evolutionary Algorithm: The AI population evolves over generations using genetic algorithms.
Fitness Calculation: The fitness of each AI is calculated based on its performance in the game.
Population Management: Functions to create, load, save, and evolve populations of AIs.
Training Loop: A loop to train the AI population over multiple episodes.
Game Simulation: Functions to simulate the game and evaluate AI performance.
