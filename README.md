# Guess The Number AI Evolution
## Project Description
This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to train an AI to play the "Guess The Number" game. The AI evolves over generations, improving its guessing strategy through selection, crossover, and mutation processes. The goal is to create an AI that can efficiently guess a number within a specified range with minimal attempts.


## Game Explanation
"Guess The Number" is a simple game where the AI attempts to guess a hidden number within a given range. The AI receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The AI uses this feedback to adjust its subsequent guesses.

## Features
just check the code xd

## Why
For the sake of science and my curiosity. I love figuring out how an AI learns something that we already know the solutions of.
It's not perfect at all as the guess is actually a float that I turn back into an integer value. I know it's dumb but I won't fix it, let's say I learned from it.
Also I was bored
